# TodoDeal
## TodoDeal -  Django Basic Application 
### Playing with Python and Django framework
> In this application, user can **create/update/delete** his/her own todo notes,
> Install **virtualenv** then create **virtualenv env** in your working directory, 
> then open **terminal** and  change directory to **todo** folder where **manage.py** file exits and type **python manage.py runserver** command

## Requirements 
* **asgiref**==3.2.3
* **Django**==3.0.3
* **django-crispy-forms**==1.8.1
* **pytz**==2019.3
* **sqlparse**==0.3.0


## Future plans
1. I will add user **authentication** and custom **admin panel** to control more options
2. so that, exiting user in database only can create/delete/update own todo note and would be able to share his all todo notes with others
3. will update **function views** into **Classview** adding more functionality 
4. will change the UI for better
